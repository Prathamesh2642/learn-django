backend development - backend application development
	admin panel
	orm
	authentication
most popular backend framework- alt - node js,laravel,spring


1.Virtual environment - it is a type of environment which consists of all the modules/libraries required for a particular project
	
	virtualenv "envname"  	-"envname" folder created
	cd "envname"
	cd Scripts
	activate

	cd ..
	cd ..

2.Django start
	pip install django
	django.__version__
	django-admin startproject "projectname"

after creation of the projectfile, from now we will be using manage.py in the project folder for further project management instead of django-admin

__init__.py - reading the folder structure : import and export of file
asgi - asynchrounous gateway interface 
wsgi - web server gateway interface
urls - mapping urls - routing
settings- project settings


creating first app in django
in the core folder

python manage.py startapp home - creates new directory home with 				 following files

__init__.py - reading and managing all the files in the directory
admin.py 	
apps.py
models.py - managing database related stuff 
tests.py - project testing stuff
views.py - project logical part - data flow from backend to frontend

in the settings section of core project file in the installed apps section add the apps name in the list to ensure that the  particular app belongs to that project



views - logical part of django app
 two types - class based and function based
we have to return actual jinja or html template from backend server

when we want to send data from backend to the html webpage we use the concept of context

to perform iteration in html code we write that specific code in 
	{% for i in range %}
	{%endfor %}
	
	{% if condition %}
	body
	{%elif condition%}
	body
	{%else%}
	body
	{%endif%}


<a href="contacts-page">Contacts</a> - used to route html pages or connect one page to another

sometimes html code or any type of code is redundant in some of the html webpage document here we can add the redundant code in one of the other files like base.html and the changing code can be given in the tag {% block start%}
    {% endblock%}


Models and Migration:
models
Responsible for database related tasks here we define the schema of the database that our project/app is going to use.
define structure

migration - most important folder.
every time you make any changes to any of the models or database you've to hit this command to register the model to sqlite database which is bydefault for django

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

if 2 or more migration files are dependent on each other and if one of the migration file is deleted whole database collapses. it can be viewed on the dbsqlite viewer if any problem has occured.

when some changes are made to the models file in django, and migrate command is hit, django creates a state of all the models file in the project and matches it with the previous states of the model to check for any changes


templates is an inbuilt directory of django hence it can be automatically read by django 

in django we can integrate html css and js at a time 

apps of django are reusable - 

booting up server 
python manage.py runserver ~ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:5000 - run on custom server ~ 127.0.0.0:8000 - 0.0.0.0:8000 = localhost
